Required Features:
------------------
- Improve send buffer implementation
	* bit operations should be improved
	* send buffers should keep track of their own memory range
		- given a pointer to a chunk they should be able to figure out the
		owner of the chunk quickly. (use a range finding data structure)
	* Need strategies to have send buffers filled continously without any holes
		* Buffers with holes (flow records not ready to flush) makes it
		difficult to flush the buffers en masse
	* Support for unlimited chunks on a buffer

- Inform Sieve of sensor's
	* Endianness
	* Sampled payload size
	* Histogram boundary(?)

Completed Features:
-------------------
- Send buffer implementation
	* Rewrite/port flush_send_buffers()
		-- figure out total flushable chunk
			* if any then:
				-- need to figure out the first flushable chunk
				-- need to figure out the first non-flushable chunk
				-- flush everything in between
	* Use bitstring.h to implement bitvector
	* Memory for flow records are managed by send buffers
		- to facilitate bulk flushing without copying
	* Implemented a less optimal send buffer
	* Uses a send_buffer pointer on flow_content to identify owner of
		flow_record (Stupid, I know!)
- Complete implementation of NabsFlow V2
	* Check to make sure vars are not over sized
	* Static Histogram
	* Put in preliminary data structures for NabsFlow V2
	* Ensure compatibility with corresponding Sieve flow module
	* Update packet/flow stats
	* Update reaction time measuresments

Dropped Features:
-----------------
- Windowed variance measurement of a flow's packet size and IAT in flow_record
	- no room in the NabsFlow v2 structure
