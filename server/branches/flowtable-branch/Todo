Pending Tasks:
==============

Source Cleanup:
 - Move all global config stuff to eunomia_config.h
 - Sensor should generate stats periodically (for each time-slot keep)
 	- flows dropped, flows in memory, flows flushed
	- packets processed, packets dropped
 - Configuration file for everything!
	
Classification:
 - Can we improve the feature computation code
 	* online computation?

Flow Table:
 - Payload Buffer Pool:
 	* some flows may have flow_content record sans payload buffer (See below)
 - Better Buffer Reuse Policy:
	* Makes no sense to buffer flows that wont fillup MAX_PAYLOAD before ACTIVE_TIMEOUT is reached
	* Give that buffer to someone else who actually needs it.
 - Flowtable can have flow_content records upto send buffer's flow_record count
 	* Basically can create flow_content as long as send buffer grants us a flow_record

Send Buffer:
 - Min-Max Send Buffer Policy:
 	* minimize system call overhead, maximize through-put 
	* bitset based send-buffer implementation

Completed Tasks:
================
 - Include the latest SVM code from libsvm
