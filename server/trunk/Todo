Required Features:
------------------
- Inform Sieve of sensor's
	* Endianness
	* sampled payload size
	* histogram boundary(?)
- A zero-copy architecture of the server
	* Avoid copying flow records into send buffers
	* Instead manage flow_record memory in send buffers themselves
		* Point flow_content.fr to point to a region in send buffer
	* Need strategies to have this buffer filled continously without any holes
		* Buffers with holes (flow records not ready to flush) makes it
		difficult to flush the buffers en masse


Completed Features:
-------------------
- Complete implementation of NabsFlow V2
	* Check to make sure vars are not over sized
	* Static Histogram
	* Put in preliminary data structures for NabsFlow V2
	* Ensure compatibility with corresponding Sieve flow module
	* Update packet/flow stats
	* Update reaction time measuresments

Dropped Features:
-----------------
- Windowed variance measurement of a flow's packet size and IAT in flow_record
	- no room in the NabsFlow v2 structure
