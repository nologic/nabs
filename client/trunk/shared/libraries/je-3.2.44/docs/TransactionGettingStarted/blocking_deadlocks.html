            It is important to understand how locking works in a
            concurrent application before continuing with a description of
            the concurrency mechanisms JE makes available to you.
            Blocking and deadlocking have important performance implications
            for your application. Consequently, this section provides a
            fundamental description of these concepts, and how they affect
            JE operations.

                When one thread of control wants to obtain access to an
                object, it requests a <span class="emphasis"><em>lock</em></span> for that
                object. This lock is what allows JE to provide your
                application with its transactional isolation guarantees by
                ensuring that:
            </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                        no other thread of control can read that object (in
                        the case of an exclusive lock), and
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        no other thread of control can modify that object
                        (in the case of an exclusive or non-exclusive lock).
                    </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="sect3" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
          <div class="titlepage">

          </div>
          <p>
                When locking occurs, there are conceptually three resources
                in use:
                </p>
          <div class="orderedlist">
            <ol type="1">
              <li>
                <p>
                        The locker.
                    </p>
                <p>
                        This is the thing that holds the lock. In a
                        transactional application, the locker is a
                        transaction handle. 
                       
                       <span> 
                        For non-transactional operations, the locker is the current thread.
                        </span>
                    </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                            The lock.        
                        </p>
                <p>
                            This is the actual data structure that locks
                            the object. In JE, a locked
                            object structure in the lock manager
                            is representative of the object that
                            is locked.
                        </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                            The locked object.
                        </p>
                <p>
                            The thing that your application
                            actually wants to lock.
                            In a JE
                            application, the locked object is usually a 
                            
                            <span>
                                database record.
                            </span>
                        </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <p>
                    JE has not set a limit for the maximum number of these resources you can use. Instead, you are
                    only limited by the amount of memory available to your application.

                    The following figure shows a transaction handle,
                    <tt class="literal">Txn A</tt>, that is holding a lock on

                    <tt class="literal">002</tt>. Only a single lock is in use

                    JE applications support both exclusive and
                    non-exclusive locks. <span class="emphasis"><em>Exclusive
                    locks</em></span> are granted when a
                    locker wants to write to an object. For this reason,
                    exclusive locks are also sometimes called
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>write locks</em></span>.
                </p>
          <p>
                    An exclusive lock prevents any other locker from
                    obtaining any sort of a lock on the object. This
                    provides isolation by ensuring that no other locker can
                    observe or modify an exclusively locked object until the locker is done
                    writing to that object.
                </p>
          <p>
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>Non-exclusive locks</em></span> are granted
                    for read-only access. For this reason, non-exclusive
                    locks are also sometimes called <span class="emphasis"><em>read
                    locks</em></span>. Since multiple lockers can
                    simultaneously hold read locks on the same
                    object, read locks are also
                    sometimes called <span class="emphasis"><em>shared locks</em></span>.
                </p>
          <p>
                    A non-exclusive lock prevents any other locker from
                    modifying the locked object while the locker is still
                    reading the object. This is how transactional cursors are able to
                    achieve repeatable reads; by default, the
                    cursor's transaction holds
                    a read lock on any object that the cursor has examined until
                    such a time as the transaction is committed
                    or aborted.

                    A locker holds its locks until such a time as it does
                    not need the lock any more. What this means is:

          <div class="orderedlist">

                            A transaction holds any locks that it obtains
                            until the transaction is committed or aborted.
                        </p>

                            until such a time as the operation is completed. 
                            For cursor operations, the lock is held until the cursor is moved to a new position or
                            closed.
                        </p>

                Simply put, a thread of control is blocked when it attempts
                to obtain a lock, but that attempt is denied because some
                other thread of control holds a conflicting lock.
                Once blocked, the thread of control is temporarily unable
                to make any forward progress until the requested lock is
                obtained or the operation requesting the lock is
                abandoned.
            </p>
        <p>
                Be aware that when we talk about blocking, strictly
                speaking the thread is not what is attempting to obtain the
                lock. Rather, some object within the thread (such as a
                cursor) is attempting to obtain the
                lock. However, once a locker attempts to
                obtain a lock, the entire thread of control must pause until the lock
                request is in some way resolved. 
            </p>
        <p>
                For example, if <tt class="literal">Txn A</tt> holds a write lock (an exclusive
                lock) on 
                             
                            <span>record</span> 
                002, then if <tt class="literal">Txn B</tt> tries to obtain a read <span class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> write lock on 
                that
                     
                    <span>record,</span> 
                        the thread of control in which <tt class="literal">Txn
                        B</tt> is running
                        is blocked:

        <div class="mediaobject">
          <img src="writeblock.jpg" />
        </div>
        <p>
                    However, if <tt class="literal">Txn A</tt> only holds a read
                    lock (a shared lock) on 
                     
                    <span>record</span> 
                    <tt class="literal">002</tt>, then only those handles that attempt to obtain a

                    <span>record</span> 
                    will block.

                        Multi-threaded 
                            
                        applications typically perform better than simple
                        single-threaded applications because the
                        application can perform one part of its workload
                        (updating  
                            <span>a database record, </span>
                            
                         for example) while it is waiting for some other
                         lengthy operation to complete (performing disk or
                         network I/O, for example). This performance
                         improvement is particularly noticeable if you use
                         hardware that offers multiple CPUs, because the threads
                            
                         can run simultaneously.
                    </p>
          <p>
                        That said, concurrent applications can see reduced
                        workload throughput if their threads of control are
                        seeing a large amount of lock contention. That is,
                        if threads are blocking on lock requests, then that
                        represents a performance penalty for your
                        application.

                        Consider once again the previous diagram of a blocked write lock request.
                        In that diagram, <tt class="literal">Txn C</tt> cannot
                        obtain its requested write lock because
                        <tt class="literal">Txn A</tt> and <tt class="literal">Txn
                        B</tt> are both already holding read locks on
                        the requested 
                             
                            <span>record.</span> 
                        In this case, the thread in which
                        <tt class="literal">Txn C</tt> is running will pause until
                        such a time as <tt class="literal">Txn C</tt> either
                        obtains its write lock, or the operation
                        that is requesting the lock is abandoned.
                        The fact that <tt class="literal">Txn
                        C</tt>'s thread has temporarily halted all
                        forward progress represents a performance penalty
                        for your application.
                    </p>
          <p>
                        Moreover, any read locks that are requested while
                        <tt class="literal">Txn C</tt> is waiting for its write
                        lock will also block until such a time as 
                        <tt class="literal">Txn C</tt> has obtained and
                        subsequently released its write lock.

                        Reducing lock contention is an important part of
                        performance tuning your concurrent JE
                        application. Applications that have multiple
                        threads of control obtaining exclusive (write)
                        locks are prone to contention issues. Moreover, as
                        you increase the numbers of lockers and as you
                        increase the time that a lock is held, you increase
                        the chances of your application seeing lock contention.
                    </p>
          <p>
                        As you are designing your application, try to do
                        the following in order to reduce lock contention:
                    </p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>
                <p>
                                Reduce the length of time your application
                                holds locks.
                            </p>
                <p>
                                Shorter lived transactions will result in
                                shorter lock lifetimes, which will in turn
                                help to reduce lock contention. 
                            </p>
                <p>
                                In addition, by default transactional cursors hold read
                                locks until such a time as the transaction is completed.
                                For this reason, try to
                                minimize the time you keep
                                transactional cursors
                                opened, or reduce your isolation
                                levels – see below.
                            </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                                If possible, access heavily accessed (read
                                or write) items toward the end of the
                                transaction. This reduces the amount of
                                time that a heavily used 
                                    
                                    <span>

                                    </span>
                                is locked by the transaction.
                            </p>
              </li>
              <li>

                                Reduce your application's isolation
                                guarantees.
                            </p>
                <p>
                                By reducing your isolation guarantees, you
                                reduce the situations in which a lock can
                                block another lock. Try using uncommitted reads
                                for your read operations in order to
                                prevent a read lock being blocked by a
                                write lock. 
                             </p>
                <p>
                                In addition, for cursors you can use degree
                                2 (read committed) isolation, which causes
                                the cursor to release its read locks as
                                soon as it is done reading the record (as
                                opposed to holding its read locks until the
                                transaction ends).
                             </p>
                <p>
                                Be aware that reducing your
                                isolation guarantees can have
                                adverse consequences for your
                                application. Before deciding
                                to reduce your isolation, take
                                care to examine your
                                application's isolation
                                requirements.

                                Depending on the nature of your application,
                                this may be something that you can not
                                do anything about. However, if it is
                                possible to create your threads such that
                                they operate only on non-overlapping
                                portions of your database, then you can
                                reduce lock contention because your
                                threads will rarely (if ever) block on one another's
                                locks.

                A deadlock occurs when two or more threads of control are
                blocked, each waiting on a resource held by the other
                thread. When this happens, there is no
                possibility of the threads ever making forward progress
                unless some outside agent takes action to break the
                deadlock.
            </p>
        <p>
                For example, if
                <tt class="literal">Txn A</tt> is
                blocked by <tt class="literal">Txn B</tt> at the same time
                <tt class="literal">Txn B</tt> is blocked by <tt class="literal">Txn
                A</tt> then the threads of control containing
                <tt class="literal">Txn A</tt> and <tt class="literal">Txn B</tt> are
                deadlocked; neither thread can make
                any forward progress because neither thread will ever release the lock
                that is blocking the other thread. 
            </p>
        <div class="mediaobject">
          <img src="deadlock.jpg" />
        </div>
        <p>
                When two threads of control deadlock, the only
                solution is to have a mechanism external to the two threads
                capable of recognizing the deadlock and notifying at least
                one thread that it is in a deadlock situation.
                Once notified, a thread of
                control must abandon the attempted operation in order to
                resolve the deadlock.

                

                <span>
                    JE is capable of notifying your application when it detects a deadlock. See
                    <a href="jelock.html#jedeadlock">Managing Deadlocks</a>
                    for more information.
                </span>
            </p>
        <p>
                Note that when one locker in a thread of control is blocked
                waiting on a lock held by another locker in that same
                thread of the control, the thread is said to be 
                <span class="emphasis"><em>self-deadlocked</em></span>.
            </p>
        <p>
                    Note that in JE, a self-deadlock can occur only if two or more transactions (lockers) are used
                    in the same thread. A self-deadlock cannot occur for non-transactional usage, because the thread is
                    the locker.

                    The things that you do to avoid lock contention also
                    help to reduce deadlocks (see <a href="blocking_deadlocks.html#blockavoidance">Avoiding Blocks</a>).

                    

                    <span>
                    Beyond that, you should also make sure all threads access data in the same order as all other
                    threads. So long as threads lock records in the same basic order, there is no possibility of a
                    deadlock (threads can still block, however).
                    </span>
                </p>
          <p>
                            Be aware that if you are using secondary databases (indices), then locking order is different for reading and writing. For this reason, if you are writing a concurrent application and you are using
                            secondary databases, you should expect deadlocks.
