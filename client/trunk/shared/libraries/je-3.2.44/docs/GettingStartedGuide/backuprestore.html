        Fundamentally, you backup your databases by copying JE log files off to a safe storage location. To restore
        your database from a backup, you copy those files to an appropriate directory on disk and reopen your JE
        application   
    </p>
      <p>
        Beyond these simple activities, there are some differing backup strategies that you may want to consider. These
        topics are described in this chapter.

            Before describing JE backup and restore, it is necessary to describe some of JE's internal workings. In
            particular, a high-level understanding of JE log files and the in-memory cache is required. You also need
            to understand a little about how JE is using its internal data structures in order to understand why
            checkpoints and/or syncs are required.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can skip this section so long as you understand that:

        <div class="itemizedlist">

            <li>
              <p>
                    JE databases are stored in log files contained in your environment directory.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    Every time a JE environment is opened, normal recovery is run. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                    For transactional applications, checkpoints should be run in order to bound normal recovery time.
                    Checkpoints are normally run by the checkpointer thread. Transactional applications and the
                    checkpointer thread are described in the
                    <i class="citetitle">Berkeley DB Java Edition Getting Started with Transaction Processing</i> guide.

            <li>
              <p>
                    For non-transactional applications, environment syncs must be performed if you want to guarantee the
                    persistence of your database modifications. Environment syncs are manually performed by the
                    application developer. See <a href="usingDbt.html#datapersist">Data Persistence</a> for details.

                Your JE database is stored on-disk in a series of log files. 
                JE uses no-overwrite log files, which is to say that JE only ever appends data to the end of a log
                file. It will never delete or modify an existing log file record. 
            </p>
          <p>
                JE log files are named
                <tt class="literal">NNNNNNNN.jdb</tt> where <tt class="literal">NNNNNNNN</tt> is an 8-digit hexadecimal number that
                increases by 1 (starting from <tt class="literal">00000000</tt>) for each log file written to disk.
            </p>
          <p>
                JE creates a new log file whenever the current log file has reached a pre-configured size (10000000
                bytes by default). This size is controlled by the <tt class="literal">je.log.fileMax</tt> properties
                parameter. See <a href="administration.html#propertyfile">The JE Properties File</a> for information on setting 
                JE properties.

          <p>
                Because JE uses no-overwrite log files, the logs must be compacted or cleaned so as to conserve disk space.
            </p>
          <p>
                JE uses the cleaner background thread to perform this task. When it runs, the cleaner thread picks
                the log file with the smallest number of active records and scans each log record in it. 
                If the record is no longer
                active in the database tree, the cleaner does nothing. If the record is still active in the tree, then
                the cleaner copies the record forward to a newer log file. 
            </p>
          <p>
                Once a log file is no longer needed (that is, it no longer contains active records), then the cleaner
                thread deletes the log file for you. Or, optionally, the cleaner thread can simply rename the discarded
                log file with a <tt class="literal">del</tt> suffix.
            </p>
          <p>
				JE uses a minimum log utilization property to determine how much cleaning to perform. The log files
				contain both obsolete and utilized records. Obsolete records are records that are no longer in use, either
				because they have been modified or because they have been deleted. Utilized records are those records
				that are currently in use. The  <tt class="literal">je.cleaner.minUtilization</tt> property identifies the
				minimum percentage of log space that must be used by utilized records. If this minimum percentage is not
				met, then log files are cleaned until the minimum percentage is met.
			</p>
          <p>
                For information on managing the cleaner thread, see <a href="backgroundthreads.html#cleaner">The Cleaner Thread</a>.

            JE databases are internally organized as a BTree. In order to operate, JE requires the complete BTree
            be available to it. 
            </p>
          <p>
            When database records are created, modified, or deleted,  the modifications are represented in the BTree's 
            leaf nodes. Beyond leaf
            node changes, database record modifications can also cause changes to other BTree nodes and structures.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>
                <h3 class="title"><a id="syncs"></a>Database Modifications and Syncs</h3>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div></div>
          </div>
          <p>
                When a write operation is performed in JE, the modified data
                is written to a leaf node contained in the in-memory cache. If
                your JE writes are performed without transactions, then the
                in-memory cache is the only location guaranteed to receive a
                database modification without further intervention on the part
                of the application developer. 
            </p>
          <p>
            For some class of applications, this lack of a guaranteed write to disk is ideal. By not writing these modifications to
            the on-disk logs, the application can avoid most of the overhead caused by disk I/O.
            </p>
          <p>
                However, if the application requires its data to persist persist at a specific point in time, then the developer must
                manually sync database modifications to the on-disk log files (again, this is only necessary for
                non-transactional applications). This is done using <tt class="classname">Environment.sync()</tt>.
            </p>
          <p>
            Note that syncing the cache causes JE to write all modified objects in the cache 
            to disk. This is probably the most expensive operation that you can perform in JE.
            </p>

          </div>
          <p>
                Every time a JE environment is opened, normal recovery is run. 
            Because of the way that JE organizes and manages its BTrees, all it needs is leaf nodes in order to
            recreate the rest of the BTree. Essentially, this is what <span class="emphasis"><em>normal recovery</em></span> is
            doing – recreating any missing parts of the internal BTree from leaf node information stored in the
            log files.
            </p>
          <p>
                Unlike a traditional database system, JE performs recovery for both transactional
                and non-transactional operations.  The integrity of the Btree is
                guaranteed by JE in the face of both application and OS crashes.
