        By default, your cache is limited to a percentage of the JVM maximum
        memory as specified by the <tt class="literal">-Xmx</tt> parameter. You can
        change this percentage by using the <tt class="literal">je.maxMemoryPercent</tt> property
        or through <tt class="methodname">EnvironmentMutableConfig.setCachePercent()</tt>.
        That is, the maximum amount of memory available to your cache is
        normally calculated as:
      </p>
      <pre class="programlisting">je.maxMemoryPercent * JVM_maximum_memory</pre>
      <p>
        You can find out what the value for this property is by using
        <tt class="methodname">EnvironmentConfig.getCachePercent()</tt>.
     </p>
      <p>
        Note that you can cause JE to use a fixed maximum cache size by
        using <tt class="literal">je.maxMemory</tt> or by using 
        <tt class="methodname">EnvironmentConfig.setCacheSize()</tt>.
     </p>
      <p>
        Also, not every JVM is capable of identifying the amount of memory requested via
        the <tt class="literal">-Xmx</tt> parameter. For those JVMs you must use
        <tt class="literal">je.maxMemory</tt> to change your maximum cache size. The
        default maximum memory available to your cache in this case is 38M.
     </p>
      <p>
        Of the amount of memory allowed for your cache, 93% is used for the internal BTree and the other 7% is
        used for internal buffers. When your application first starts up, the 7% for buffers is immediately allocated.
        The remainder of the cache grows lazily as your application reads and writes data. 
     </p>
      <p>
        In order for your application to start up successfully, the Java virtual machine must have enough memory
        available to it (as identified by the <tt class="literal">-Xmx</tt> command line switch) for both your application and
        7% of your maximum cache value. In order for your application to run continuously (all the while loading data
        into the cache), you must make sure your JVM has enough memory for your application plus the maximum cache size.
     </p>
      <p>
        The best way to determine how large your cache needs to be is to put your application into a production
        environment and watch to see how much disk I/O is occurring. If the application is going to disk quite a lot to
        retrieve database records, then you should increase the size of your cache (provided that you have enough memory
        to do so). 
     </p>
      <p>
        In order to determine how frequently your application is going to disk for database records not found in the
        cache, you can examine the value returned by <tt class="methodname">EnvironmentStats.getNCacheMiss()</tt>. 
     </p>
      <p>
        <tt class="methodname">EnvironmentStats.getNCacheMiss()</tt> identifies the total number of requests for database objects that were
        not serviceable from the cache. This value is cumulative since the application started. The faster this number grows, 
        the more your application is going to disk to service database operations. Upon application startup you can
        expect this value to grow quite rapidly. However, as time passes and your cache is seeded with your most
        frequently accessed database records, what you want is for this number's growth to be zero or at least very
        small.
     </p>

        Note that this statistic can only be collected from within the application itself or using the JMX extension
        (see <a href="jmx.html">JMX Support</a>).
