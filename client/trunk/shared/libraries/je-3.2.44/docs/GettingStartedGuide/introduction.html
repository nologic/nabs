      <p>
  Welcome to Berkeley DB Java Edition (JE).  JE is a general-purpose, transaction-protected, embedded database written in 100%
  Java (JE makes no JNI calls). As such, it offers the Java developer safe and efficient in-process storage and
  management of arbitrary data.
  </p>
      <p>JE requires Java J2SE 1.4.2 or later.</p>
      <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
        <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to the APIs described in this book, JE also
          offers the Direct Persistence Layer (DPL). The DPL is implemented as
          a layer on top of JE. Using it, you can cause any Java type
          to be persistent without implementing special interfaces.
    </p>
        <p>
            We recommend that you use the
            DPL if all you want is to make classes with
            relatively static schemas to be persistent.
    </p>
        <p>
            The only caveat to this recommendation is that the DPL
            requires Java 1.5, while JE does not. If you want to
            use Java 1.4, you must use the JE APIs.
    </p>
        <p>
            You can find a brief introduction to the DPL
            in the <i class="citetitle">Berkeley DB Java Edition Getting Started with the Direct Persistence Layer</i> guide.

        <p>
        JE provides an enterprise-class Java-based data management solution. You use JE through a series of
        Java APIs.  All you need to get started is to add a single jar file to your application's classpath. See
        <a href="gettingit.html">Getting and Using 
	JE
</a> for more information.
    </p>
        <p>
	JE offers the following major features:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
        Large database support.  JE databases efficiently scale from one to millions of records. 
        The size of your JE databases are likely to be limited
        more by hardware resources than by any limits imposed upon you by JE.
        </p>
              <p>Databases are described in <a href="DB.html">Databases</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
            Multiple thread and process support.  JE is designed for multiple threads of control.
            Both read and write operations can be performed by multiple threads.  JE uses record-level locking for
            high concurrency in threaded applications.  Further, JE uses
            timeouts for deadlock detection to help you
            ensure that two threads of control do not deadlock indefinitely.
        </p>
              <p>
        Moreover, JE allows multiple processes to access the same databases. However, in this
        configuration JE requires that there be no more than one process allowed to write to the
        database. Read-only processes are guaranteed a consistent, although
        potentially out of date, view of the stored data as of the time that the
        environment is opened.
        </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Database records. All database records are organized as simple
        key/data pairs. Both keys and data can be anything from primitive Java
        types to the most complex of Java objects.
        </p>
              <p>Database records are described in <a href="DBEntry.html">Database Records</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Transactions. Transactions allow you to treat one or more
        operations on one or more databases as a single unit of work. 
		JE transactions offer the application developer recoverability, atomicity, and
        isolation for your database operations.
        </p>
              <p>Note that transaction protection is optional. Transactions are
                described in the <i class="citetitle">Berkeley DB Java Edition Getting Started with Transaction Processing</i> guide.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Indexes.  JE allows you to easily create and maintain
        secondary indices for your primary data through the use of secondary databases. 
        In this way, you can obtain rapid access to your data through the use of an alternative, or secondary, key.
        </p>
              <p>Indexes are described in <a href="indexes.html">Secondary Databases</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>In-memory cache. The cache allows for high speed database access
        for both read and write operations by avoiding unnecessary disk I/O.
        The cache will grow on demand up to a pre-configured maximum size. To improve your application's
        performance immediately after startup time, you can preload your cache in order to avoid disk I/O
        for production requests of your data.
        </p>
              <p>Cache management is described in <a href="cachesize.html">Sizing the Cache</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
            Log files. JE databases are stored in one
            or more sequential numerically-named log files in the environment
            directory.  The log files are write-once and are
            portable across platforms with different endian-ness.
        </p>
              <p>
            Note that unlike other database implementations, there is no
            distinction between database files (that is, the &quot;material
            database&quot;) and log files. Instead JE employs a log-based storage
            system to protect database modifications. Before any
            change is made to a database, JE writes information about the
            change to the log file.
        </p>
              <p>
            Note that JE's log files are not binary compatible with Berkeley
            DB's database files. However, both products provide dump and load
            utilities, and the files that these operate on are compatible across
            product lines.
        </p>
              <p>
            JE's log files are described in more detail in 
            <a href="backuprestore.html">Backing up and Restoring Berkeley DB Java Edition Applications</a>.
            For information on using JE's dump and load utilities,
            see <a href="commandlinetools.html">The Command Line Tools</a>.
            Finally, for a short list of things to know about log files while you are learning JE,
            see <a href="logfilesrevealed.html">Six Things Everyone Should Know about JE Log Files</a>.
        </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Background threads.  JE provides several threads that manage internal 
        resources for you.  The checkpointer is responsible for flushing database data to disk that was
        written to cache as the result of a transaction commit (this is done in order to shorten 
        recovery time).  The compressor thread removes subtrees from the
        database that are empty because of deletion activity. Finally,
        the cleaner thread is responsible for cleaning and removing unneeded
        log files, thereby helping you to save on disk space.</p>
              <p>Background thread management is described in 
        <a href="backgroundthreads.html">Managing the Background Threads</a>.
        </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Database environments. Database environments provide a unit of
        encapsulation and management for one or more databases. In addition,
        an environment is the unit of management for internal resources such
        as the in-memory cache and the background threads. Environments are also
        used to manage concurrency and transactions. Note that all
        applications using JE are required to use database environments.</p>
              <p>Database environments are described in <a href="Env.html">Database Environments</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Backup and restore.  JE's backup procedure consists of simply copying JE's 
        log files to a safe location for storage.
        To recover from a catastrophic failure, you copy your archived log files 
        back to your production location on
        disk and reopen the JE environment.
        </p>
              <p>
            Note that JE always performs <span class="emphasis"><em>normal recovery</em></span> when it opens a database environment.
            Normal recovery brings the database to a consistent state based on change information found in the database
            log files.
        </p>
              <p>

            <a href="backuprestore.html">Backing up and Restoring Berkeley DB Java Edition Applications</a>.
        </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
            JCA. JE provides support for the Java Connector Architecture. See
            <a href="jca.html">JCA Support</a> for more information.
        </p>
            </li>
            <li>
