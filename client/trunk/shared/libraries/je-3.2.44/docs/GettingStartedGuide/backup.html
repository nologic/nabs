            This section describes how to backup your JE database(s) such that catastrophic recovery is possible for
            non-transactional applications. Note that this same material is repeated in the 
            <i class="citetitle">Berkeley DB Java Edition Getting Started with Transaction Processing</i>
            guide, but for transactional applications. If you are writing transactional
            applications, you may want to skip the rest of this chapter and go straight to that book.
        </p>
      <p>
            To backup your database, you can either take a hot backup or an
            offline backup. A hot backup
            is performed while database write operations are in progress. 
        </p>
      <p>
            Do not confuse hot and offline backups with the concept of a full and incremental backup.  Both a
            hot and an offline backup are full backups – you back up the entire database. The only difference
            between them is how much of the contents of the in-memory cache are contained in them. On the other hand, 
            an incremental backup is a backup of just those log files modified or created since the time of the last
            backup.  Most backup software
            is capable of performing both full and incremental backups for you.

        <p>
                To perform a hot backup of your JE databases, copy all log files 
                (<tt class="filename">*.jdb</tt> files) from your environment directory to
                your archival location or backup media. The files must be copied
                in alphabetical order (numerical in effect). You do not have to 
                stop any database operations in order to do this.
            </p>
        <p>
               To make this process a bit easier, you may want to make use of the
               <tt class="classname">DbBackup</tt> helper class. See 
               <a href="backup.html#dbbackuphelper">Using the DbBackup Helper Class</a>
               for details.
            </p>
        <p>
                Note that any modifications made to the database
                since the time of the last environment sync are not guaranteed to be contained in these log files.
                In this case, you may want to consider running an offline backup in order to guarantee the availability
                of all modifications made to your database.

                An offline backup guarantees that you have captured the database in its entirety, including all contents
                of your in-memory cache, at the moment that the
                backup was taken. To do this, you must make sure that no write operations are in progress and all
                database modifications have been written to your log files
                on disk.  To obtain an offline backup:

              <p>
                        Run <tt class="methodname">Environment.sync()</tt> so as to
                        ensure that all database modifications are written to disk. Note that cleanly closing your
                        environment will also ensure that all database modifications are written to disk.
                    </p>

            <li>
              <p>

                        To make this process a

                        <tt class="classname">DbBackup</tt> helper class. See
                        the next section for details.

                        In order to simplify backup operations, JE
                        provides the <tt class="classname">DbBackup</tt> helper
                        class. This class stops and restarts JE background activity 
                        in an open environment. It also lets the application create a 
                        backup which can support restoring the environment to 
                        a specific point in time.
                </p>
        <p>
                    Because you do not have to stop JE write activity
                    in order to take a backup, it is usually necessary to
                    examine your log files twice before you decide that
                    your backup is complete. This is because JE may
                    create a new log file while you are running your
                    backup. A second pass over your log files allows you to
                    ensure that no new files have been created and so you
                    can declare your backup complete.
                </p>
        <p>
                    For example:
                </p>
        <pre class="programlisting"> time    files in                    activity
         environment

  t0     000000001.jdb     Backup starts copying file 1
         000000003.jdb
         000000004.jdb

  t1     000000001.jdb     JE log cleaner migrates portion of file 3 to newly
         000000004.jdb     created file 5 and deletes file 3. Backup finishes
         000000005.jdb     file 1, starts copying file 4. Backup MUST include
                           file 5 for a consistent backup!

  t2     000000001.jdb     Backup finishes copying file 4, starts and finishes
         000000004.jdb     file 5, has caught up. Backup ends.
         000000005.jdb
</pre>
        <p>
                    <tt class="classname">DbBackup</tt> works around this
                    problem by defining the set of files that must be
                    copied for each backup operation, and freezes all
                    changes to those files. The application can copy that
                    defined set of files and finish operation without
                    checking for the ongoing creation of new files. Also,
                    there will be no need to check for a newer version of
                    the last file on the next backup.
            </p>
        <p>
                    In the example above, if <tt class="classname">DbBackup</tt> was used at t0,
                    the application would only have to copy files 1, 3 and
                    4 to back up. On a subsequent backup, the application
                    could start its copying at file 5. There would be no
                    need to check for a newer version of file 4.
            </p>
        <p>
                The following code fragment illustrates this class' usage:
            </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">package je.gettingStarted;

...
import com.sleepycat.je.util.DbBackup;
...

    Environment env = new Environment(...);
    DbBackup backupHelper = new DbBackup(env);

    // Find the file number of the last file in the previous backup
    // persistently, by either checking the backup archive, or saving
    // state in a persistent file.
    long lastFileCopiedInPrevBackup =  ...

    // Start backup, find out what needs to be copied.
    backupHelper.startBackup();
    try {
        String[] filesForBackup =
             backupHelper.getLogFilesInBackupSet(lastFileCopiedInPrevBackup);

        // Copy the files to archival storage.
        myApplicationCopyMethod(filesForBackup)
        // Update our knowlege of the last file saved in the backup set,
        // so we can copy less on the next backup
        lastFileCopiedInPrevBackup = backupHelper.getLastFileInBackupSet();
        myApplicationSaveLastFile(lastFileCopiedInBackupSet);
    }
    finally {
        // Remember to exit backup mode, or all log files won't be cleaned
        // and disk usage will bloat.
       backupHelper.endBackup();
   } </pre>
