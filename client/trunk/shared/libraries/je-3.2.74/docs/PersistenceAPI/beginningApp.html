          In this chapter we will build a couple of basic applications that
          use the DPL to store and retrieve objects. To do this, we will 
          create two applications that use fictional inventory and vendor
          information. The first application,
          <tt class="literal">ExampleDatabasePut</tt>, is used to create
          inventory and vendor objects that are stored for later retrieval.
          The second application, <tt class="literal">ExampleInventoryRead</tt>,
          is used to retrieve and display this data.
   </p>
      <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
        <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
        <p>
                The examples that we use here are identical to the examples
                provided in the <i class="citetitle">Getting Started with Berkeley DB Java Edition</i> guide.
                The only difference is that the DPL is used
                instead of the JE API. We did this to make it easier to
                compare the two APIs.
           </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Before we begin building our main applications, which are used to
        perform data reads and writes, we have to build several other
        classes that provide important infrastructure for our application.
        These classes encapsulate the data we want to store, provide data
        access to the data store, and open and close our data store.
    </p>
      <div class="sect1" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="persistobject"></a>Persistent Objects</h2>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div></div>
        </div>
        <p>
                To begin, we build the classes that we actually want to
                store. In our case, we build two such classes; a class that
                contains product inventory information and a class that
                contains vendor contact information.
            </p>
        <p>
                These classes look pretty much the same as any class might
                that encapsulates data. They have private data members that
                hold the information and they have getter and setter
                methods for data access and retrieval.
            </p>
        <p>
                However, to use these with the DPL, the classes
                must be decorated with Java annotations that identify the
                classes as either an entity class or a persistent class.
                Java annotations are also used to identify primary and
                secondary indices.
            </p>

          <div class="titlepage">

                        The DPL is used to store Java objects
                        in an underlying series of databases (accessed via
                        an <span class="emphasis"><em>EntityStore</em></span>). To do this,
                        you must identify classes to be stored as either
                        entity classes or persistent classes.
                    </p>
          <p>
                        Entity classes are classes that have a primary index,
                        and optionally one or more secondary indices. That is,
                        these are the classes that you will save and
                        retrieve directly using the DPL.
                        You identify an entity class using the
                        <tt class="literal">@Entity</tt> java annotation.
                    </p>
          <p>
                        Persistent classes are classes used by entity
                        classes. They do not have primary or secondary
                        indices used for object retrieval. Rather, they are
                        stored or retrieved when an entity class makes
                        direct use of them.  You identify an persistent class using the
                        <tt class="literal">@Persistent</tt> java annotation.
                    </p>
          <p>
                            Note that all non-transient instance fields of
                            a persistent class, as well as its superclasses
                            and subclasses, are persistent. static and
                            transient fields are not persistent. The
                            persistent fields of a class may be private,
                            package-private (default access), protected or
                            public.
                    </p>
          <p>
                        Note that simple Java types, such as
                        <tt class="classname">java.lang.String</tt> and
                        <tt class="classname">java.util.Date</tt>, 
                        are automatically handled as a
                        persistent class when you use them in an entity
                        class; you do not have to do anything special to cause
                        these simple Java objects to be stored in the
                        <tt class="classname">EntityStore</tt>.
                    </p>

        <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
          <div class="titlepage">

          </div>
          <p>
                        The simplest class that our example wants to store contains
                        vendor contact information. This class contains no
                        secondary indices so all we have to do is identify it
                        as an entity class and identify the field in the
                        class used for the primary key.
                    </p>
          <p>
                        Primary and secondary indices are described in detail
                        in the <i class="citetitle">Getting Started with Berkeley DB Java Edition</i> guide,
                        but essentially a primary index is the
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>main</em></span> information
                        you use to organize and retrieve a given object.
                        Primary index keys
                        are always unique to the object
                        in order to make it easier to locate them in the
                        data store.
                    </p>
          <p>
                        Conversely, secondary indices represent other
                        information that you might use to locate an object.
                        We discuss these more in the next section.
                    </p>
          <p>
                        In the following example, we identify the
                        <tt class="literal">vendor</tt> data member as containing the
                        primary key. This data member is meant to contain a
                        vendor's name. Because of the way we will use our
                        <tt class="classname">EntityStore</tt>, the value
                        provided for this data member must be unique within
                        the store or runtime errors will result.
                    </p>
          <p>
                        When used with the DPL, our
                        <tt class="classname">Vendor</tt> class appears as
                        follows. Notice that the <tt class="literal">@Entity</tt>
                        annotation appears immediately before the class
                        declaration, and the <tt class="literal">@PrimaryKey</tt>
                        annotation appears immediately before the
                        <tt class="literal">vendor</tt> data member declaration.

                            For this class, the <tt class="literal">vendor</tt> value is set for an individual
                            <tt class="classname">Vendor</tt> class object by
                            the <tt class="methodname">setVendorName()</tt>
                            method. If our example code fails to set this
                            value before storing the object, the data
                            member used to store the primary key is set to a
                            null value. This would result in a runtime
                            error.

          <p>
                            You can avoid the need to explicitly set a
                            value for a class' primary index by specifying
                            a sequence to be used for the primary key. This
                            results in an unique integer value being used
                            as the primary key for each stored object.
                    </p>
          <p>
                        You declare a sequence is to be used by specifying
                        the <tt class="literal">sequence</tt> keyword to the
                        <tt class="literal">@PrimaryKey</tt> annotation.
                        For example:

long myPrimaryKey; </pre>
          <p>
                        If you provide the <tt class="literal">sequence</tt> keyword with a name, 
                        then the sequence is obtained from that named sequence.  For example:
                    </p>

                            class in that it is simply used to encapsulate
                            data. However, in this case we want to be able
                            to access objects two different ways: by
                            product SKU and by product name.
                    </p>
          <p>
                        In our data set, the product SKU is required to be
                        unique, so we use that as the primary key. The
                        product name, however, is not a unique value so we
                        set this up as a secondary key.
                    </p>
          <p>
                         The class appears as follows in our example:

                        To declare a secondary index, we use the

                        that when we do this, we must declare what sort of
                        an index it is; that is, what is its relationship to
                        other data in the data store.

                        The <span class="emphasis"><em>kind</em></span> of indices that we

                                        This relationship indicates that
                                        the secondary key is unique to the
                                        object. If an object is stored with a
                                        secondary key that already
                                        exists in the data store, a run

                                        For example, a person object might
                                        be stored with a primary key of a

                                        with a secondary key of the
                                        person's employee number. Both
                                        values are expected to be unique in

                                        Consider a data store that relates
                                        managers to employees. A given
                                        manager will have multiple
                                        employees, but each employee is
                                        assumed to have just one manager.
                                        In this case, the manager's
                                        employee number might be a
                                        secondary key, so that you can

                                        related to that manager's
                                        employees.

                                        Indicates that the secondary key
                                        might be used more than once for a
                                        given object. Index keys
                                        themselves are assumed to be
                                        unique, but multiple instances of
                                        the index can be used per object.

                  <p>
                                        For example, employees might have
                                        multiple unique email addresses. In
                                        this case, any given object can be
                                        access by one or more email
                                        addresses. Each such address is
                                        unique in the data store, but each
                                        such address will relate to a 
                                        single employee object.

                  <p>
                                        There can be multiple keys for
                                        any given object, and for any given
                                        key there can be many related
                                        objects.

                                            For example, suppose your
                                            organization has a shared
                                            resource, such as printers. You
                                            might want to track which
                                            printers a given employee can
                                            use (there might be more than
                                            one). You might also want to
                                            track which employees can use a
                                            specific printer. This
                                            represents a many-to-many
                                            relationship.

            <p>
                        Note that for <tt class="literal">ONE_TO_ONE</tt> and

                        need a simple data member (not an array or
                        collection) to hold the key. For
                        <tt class="literal">ONE_TO_MANY</tt> and
                        <tt class="literal">MANY_TO_MANY</tt> relationships, you
                        need an array or collection to hold the keys:

            <pre class="programlisting">@SecondaryKey(relate=ONE_TO_ONE)

                            Sometimes a secondary index is related in some
                            way to another entity class that is also
                            contained in the data store. That is, the
                            secondary key might be the primary key for
                            another entity class. If this is the case, you
                            can declare the foreign key constraint to make
                            data integrity easier to accomplish.
                         </p>
            <p>
                            For example, you might have one class that is
                            used to represent employees.
                            You might have another that is used to
                            represent corporate divisions. When you add or
                            modify an employee record, you might want to
                            ensure that the division to which the employee
                            belongs is known to the data store. You do this
                            by specifying a foreign key constraint.
                         </p>
            <p>
                            When a foreign key constraint is declared:

                                                 When a new secondary key
                                                 for the object is stored,
                                                 it is checked to make sure
                                                 it exists as a primary

                                                 entity object. If it does
                                                 not, a runtime error
                                                 occurs.

                                                 definable by you. See
                                                 below.
                                         </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                            When a related entity is deleted from the data
                            store, one of the following actions are taken:
                         </p>
            <div class="itemizedlist">
              <ul type="disc">
                <li>
                  <p>
                                                 <tt class="literal">ABORT</tt>
                                         </p>
                  <p>
                                                The delete operation is not
                                                allowed. A runtime error is
                                                raised as a result of the
                                                operation. This is the
                                                default behavior.

                  <p>
                                            All entities related to this
                                            one are deleted as well. For
                                            example, if you deleted a
                                            <tt class="classname">Division</tt> 
                                            object, then all
                                            <tt class="classname">Employee</tt>
                                            objects that belonged to the
                                            division are also deleted.
                                         </p>

                                            All entities related to the
                                            deleted entity are updated so
                                            that the pertinent data member
                                            is nullified. That is, if you
                                            deleted a division, then all
                                            employee objects related to
                                            that division would have their
                                            division key
                                            automatically set to null.

            <p>
                            You declare a foreign key constraint by using
                            the <tt class="literal">relatedEntity</tt> keyword. You
                            declare the foreign key constraint deletion policy using the
                            <tt class="literal">onRelatedEntityDelete</tt> keyword. For
                            example, the following declares a foreign key
                            constraint to <tt class="classname">Division</tt>
                            class objects, and it causes related objects to
                            be deleted if the <tt class="classname">Division</tt>
                            class is deleted:
