        JE log files are not like the log files of other database systems.  Nor are they like the log files or database
        files created by Berkeley DB C Edition.  In this guide you will learn more about log files as you go along, but it is good
        to keep the following points in mind as you begin using JE.
    </p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <p>
                JE log files are &quot;append only&quot;.  Record insertions, deletions, and updates are always added at the end
                of the current file.  The first file is named <tt class="literal">00000000.jdb</tt>.  When that file grows to a certain size
                (10 MB by default) a new file named <tt class="literal">00000001.jdb</tt> becomes the current file, and so on. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                There are no separate database files.  Unlike Berkeley DB C Edition, databases are not stored in files
                that are separate from the transaction log.  The transaction log and the database records are stored
                together in a single sequential log consisting of multiple log files.               
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                The JE cleaner is responsible for reclaiming unused disk space.  When the records in a log file are
                superseded by deletions or updates recorded in a later log file, the older log file is no longer fully
                utilized.  The cleaner, which operates by default as a separate thread, determines the least utilized
                log files, copies any still utilized records in those files to the end of the current log file, and
                finally deletes the now completely un-utilized log file.
            </p>
            <p>
                See <a href="backgroundthreads.html#cleaner">The Cleaner Thread</a> for more information on the cleaner.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
               Cleaning does not start immediately and never produces 100% utilization.  Until you have written enough
               data to create several log files, and some of that data is obsoleted through deletions and updates, you
               will not notice any log files being deleted by the cleaner.  By default cleaning occurs in the background and
               maintains the log files at 50% utilization.  You can configure a higher utilization value, but
               configuring too high a utilization value will reduce overall performance.                
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                Cleaning is not automatically performed when closing the environment.  If you wish to reduce unused disk
                space to a minimum at a particular point in time, you must explicitly call a method to perform log
                cleaning.  See the <a href="EnvClose.html">Closing Database Environments</a> for more information.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
                Log file deletion only occurs after a checkpoint.  The cleaner prepares log files to be deleted, but
                file deletion must be performed after a checkpoint to ensure that the files are no longer referenced.
                Checkpoints occur on their own schedule, which is every 20 MB of log written, by default.  This is part
                of the reason that you will not see log files being deleted until after several files have been created.
